                <div class="slide" id="slide1">
                    <p>Hello and welcome.</p>
                    <p>Have you ever played a game you enjoyed a lot but couldn't understand why? Have you ever played a game you thought was fine but felt like it lacked something? Or perhaps a game you just couldn't get into altogether?</p>
                    <p><a class="button" onclick="next('slide1', 'slide2');">Next</a></p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide2">
                    <p>Take a second to look back at all the games you have played and think about which one is your favorite. More importantly, think about why that game is your favorite.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide2', 'slide1');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide2', 'slide3');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide3">
                    <p>Okay, you probably weren't thinking like I asked. Anyway...</p>
                    <p><strong>Game design</strong> is often the reason behind why certain games get more acclaim over others. Games with strong game design tend to be personal favorites over games that lack game design.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide3', 'slide2');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide3', 'slide4');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide4">
                    <p>But what <em>is</em> strong game design? Is it about difficulty curves? Mechanics? Physics? Maybe emotional storylines that can drive even stoics to tears?</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide4', 'slide3');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide4', 'slide5');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide5">
                    <p>Strong game design is hard to define and is very subjective. A game might not appeal to one person the same way it will to another.</p>
                    <p>However, there are <strong>four elements</strong> of game design to consider when developing a game with the intention of attracting an audience and keeping them gaming. These elements are <strong>challenge, choice, change, and chance.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide5', 'slide4');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide5', 'slide6');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide6">
                    <p>To further elaborate each of these elements, I have provided a simple game of Snake on the left that you can play as you read through.</p>
                    <p>Use the arrow or WASD keys to move your <a id="pink">snake</a> around. Collect <a id="purple">fruit</a> to make your snake longer.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide6', 'slide5');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide6', 'slide7');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide7">
                    <p>The first element is <strong>challenge.</strong></p>
                    <p>Challenge is the main element of a game. It provides the player obstacles they have to overcome in order to reach a goal and win the game. Whether that goal is to get the high score, save the princess, or drive from point A to point B without crashing, overcoming challenges gives the player a rewarding sense of feeling.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide7', 'slide6');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide7', 'slide8');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide8">
                    <p>Reaching these goals typically won't require one single challenge, but a series of challenges. If the distance from point A to point B is too short, it would make a pretty boring game. Lengthening the distance between these two points provides more obstacles to the player and keeps them on their toes.</p>
                    <p>For the case of Snake, reaching a score of 5 to win the game would be too easy. However, increase the target score to 100 and the player is presented with a stronger challenge, making the end goal more rewarding.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide8', 'slide7');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide8', 'slide9');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide9">
                    <p>The second element is <strong>choice.</strong></p>
                    <p>Choice affects the path the player takes and the overall outcome of a game. The decisions a player will make will depend on the conditions of the game and the overall situation the player is in. If the player is given a choice between a Water move and an Earth move against a Fire opponent, the player will most likely pick the Water move to defeat the Fire opponent.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide9', 'slide8');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide9', 'slide10');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide10">
                    <p>Decisions make the challenge more interesting. Make the wrong choice and the player loses as a result. Make the right choice and the player is on track to win the game. A game that lacks choice is like playing with the difficulty mode set to "Auto." The player just lets the game do all the deciding and that's not really a gaming experience.</p>
                    <p>In Snake, the player is free to move in any direction they want. Whether or not they want to move in that direction is up for them to decide, but they obviously don't want to go left if that means the snake crashing into itself.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide10', 'slide9');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide10', 'slide11');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide11">
                    <p>The third element is <strong>change.</strong></p>
                    <p>Making a game too repetitive means making it too predictable. Change offers unexpected and new elements in a game to make the challenge more interesting. Things like introducing harder enemies and increasing the overall difficulty as the player progresses throughout the game.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide11', 'slide10');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide11', 'slide12');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide12">
                    <p>If you keep throwing the same obstacles and enemies at the player, they will already know how to overcome those obstacles because they did before. Introducing new obstacles will keep the player hooked as they continuously use their problem solving skills.</p>
                    <p>For Snake, the tail will get longer as the snake eats more fruit. This gives the snake less room to reach the fruit and more of an obstacle as it wants to avoid colliding with the tail. The snake will also get faster as the game progresses, giving the player less time to react.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide12', 'slide11');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide12', 'slide13');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide13">
                    <p>The last element is <strong>chance.</strong></p>
                    <p>Chance is like rolling dice at a board game. The player's desired number of spaces they want to move may not match what the dice actually says. This element of chance encourages the players to plan accordingly and prepare for the unexpected. A perfect solution for one game may not be a perfect solution the next game.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide13', 'slide12');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide13', 'slide14');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide14">
                    <p>Chance goes hand in hand with change in providing more variety to a game and making it less static and predictable. The element of chance is like a random version of the element of change. Change may require skill to overcome obstacles, but chance often requires some element of luck as well.</p>
                    <p>Every time the snake eats one fruit, a new fruit will generate in a random location. This randomness ensures that the player does not take the same path to collect fruit each game and may require the player to reach the fruit in tricky spots like corners or within the parameter of the snake's tail.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide14', 'slide13');">Previous</a>
                        <a class="button" onclick="next('slide14', 'slide15');">Next</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide" id="slide15">
                    <p>As a quick recap, here are the four elements of game design:</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge</strong>, which consists of obstacles to overcome in order to reach a goal.</p>
                    <p><strong>Choice</strong>, the ability for players to make decisions when faced with a challenge.</p>
                    <p><strong>Change</strong>, the variability of the game's content in order to provide new challenges.</p>
                    <p><strong>Chance</strong>, the randomness within a game to make players plan for the unexpected.</p>
